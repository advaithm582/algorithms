# Algorithms

This repository contains some implementations of algorithms which are in syllabus of the INOI.

## Table of Algorithms
> **Note:** Refer to the [Wiki](../../wiki) for a complete index.

 - The `*` denotes that the file is not available.
 - The `^` denotes that the file is a Unit Test, instead of a demo.
 - The `-` denotes that the file is an executable program.

> **Note:** The C++ Solutions are just ports of the Python solutions and thus may not be the most efficient way to implement the algorithm in that programming language.
