# Description
An algorithm to sort a list

# Working
 - We check element by element. If one is greater than the other, we switch them.

# Time Complexity
 - As the list sorts \\(n\\) times, and repeats this \\(n\\) times, the time complexity is \\( O(n^2) \\)
 - As a result this algorithm is too innefficient. Have a look at \\( O(n \log_2 n) \\) algorithms, such as [Merge Sort](../mergesort/) of [Quick Sort](../quicksort/)
